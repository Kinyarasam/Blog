                Have you ever wondered what happens when you search something on  your Browser. In this Blog post I'll try to de-mystyfy what usually happens wheb you look something up.
                <br><br>
                Communication on the web is made possible when there we have two applications/machines/softwares communicating.

                <h3><b>Definition of Terms</b></h3>
                The following are some of the terms that may be worth learning as you learn more about how the web works. They may include;
                <li>
                    <b>Client</b>
                </li>
                A client can be defined as a program that uses resources provided by the server.
                
                <li>
                    <b>Server</b>
                </li>
                A Server can be defined as the program/special software that makes this resource available to the client and is responsible for memory locations.
                
                <li>
                    DNS
                </li>
                The initials represent the Domain Name System. The DNS is responsible for translating human readable domain names into machine readable ip addresses.
                
                <li>
                    Ip address
                </li>
                An <b>ip address</b> is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.
                
                <li>
                    ISP
                </li>
                ISP refers to the internet service provider. This may be a company that provides individuals, organizations or other companies access to the internet and other related services.
